1. The first step in Linux privilege escalation exploitation is to check for files with the 
SUID/GUID bit set. This means that the file or files can be run with the permissions of the 
file(s) owner/group. In this case, as the super-user. We can leverage this to get a shell with these privileges!

2. Misconfigured Binaries and GTFOBins

GTFOBins is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be exploited by an attacker to 
bypass local security restrictions. It provides a really useful breakdown of how to 
exploit a misconfigured binary and is the first place you should look if you find one on a CTF or Pentest.

3. Exploting Crontab

 use msfvemon to generate the reverse shell code and put it in the script running as the priv esc account

 4. Exploiting path variable
