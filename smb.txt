Samba is based on the common client/server protocol of Server Message Block (SMB). 
SMB is developed only for Windows, without Samba, 
other computer platforms would be isolated from Windows machines, 
even if they were part of the same network.

SMB has two ports, 445 and 139
Latest version runs on 445 port on top of a TCP stack.

use this scripts tags in nmap to find the shares.
nmap -p 445 --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse 10.10.214.71

That will give you the shares and the users to access the path

- use smbclient //IP/sharename to access that share
also for a specific username:
- smbclient //IP/sharename -U username


- use smbget smb://IP/sharname to download the files
